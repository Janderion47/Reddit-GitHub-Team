# Super-Quadratic Encryption

This code was originally from Janderion47's
[String-Encryption Repository](https://github.com/Janderion47/String-Encryption).

Explanation: <br>
Each variable "a, b & c" require three inputs in brackets; \[1, 2].
Number 1 of each variable defines the normal "a, b, c" as in L1 to L4.
Number 2 defines how much each variable will change with each step.
The step variable defines how many times the data will be fed through
the math equation in the "do_over" function; the default is 5 steps.

Hopefully we can improve it to be better than i could have made it before.
