# Alex here - just following along with a YouTube tutorial to see what I can do with SoundCloud API
# Never used APIs before so this should be fun

# Using Python 3.7 right now (as I can't work out how to change to 3.6 in PyCharm)
# May need to install 3.6
# (Denis in the Slack stated that 3.6 has more API compatility)
